    What makes an API RESTful?
        1. Uses HTTP Methods:
            GET POST PUT PATCH DELETE
            -standard verbs to interact with a RESTful API
        2. Have a standard data format that it responds with:
            JSON format, XML
            -> client
            representation part of the representational state transfer
        3. Client-server in RESTful APIs are complete separate
            message each other over a network
            to make requests and get back responses
        4. Stateless
            each request from the client to the server should contain
            all the information that's needed to understand and process the request

            each single request/response is complete
            without need to know what happened previously
        5. Resource-based
            Unique Resource Identifier/Locator
            URI/URL

Creating GET Routes
    req.params: path parameters
    array.find(callback => condition) | loop to find
    query params
        /filter
        type = req.query.type;
    array.filter(callback => condition) | loop to filter and return an array

Creating POST, PUT, and PATCH Routes
    jokeText: req.body.text || currentJoke.jokeText
        if (req.body.text) {
            jokeText = req.body.text
        } else {
            jokeText = currentJoke.jokeText
        }
    jokes.slice(-1) | take the last element

Creating the DELETE Routes
    jokes.splice(searchIndex, 1) | remove the joke with that index, remove only one element from the array

Build your own API for a Blog
    if (!post) return res.status(404).json({ message: "Post not found" })
    res.status(201).json(newPost);
    if (req.body.title) post.title = req.body.title;
