        store hash into database

How to Hack Passwords

Level 3 - How to Salt Passwords for Improved Encryption
    Salting
        password + salt -(hash function)-> hash
    bcrypt: standard hashing algorithms
    salt rounds
        round n+: hash + salt -> hash
    
    bcrypt.compare(loginPassword, storedHashedPassword) // Have to be in this order

Managing Cookies and Sessions
    passport
    passport go after session
