Display Flex
    Creating tables:
        <table>
            <tr class="row">
                <td class="col1">...</td>
                <td class="col2">...</td>
                <td class="col3">...</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        - for tabular data better
        - not for web design
    Flex:
        display: flex (but doesn't relate to inline/block/inline-block)
        gap
        width: based on the content size

        inline-flex: box can occupy as much space as it needs
        but other can also goes into the same line

Flex Direction
    flex direction: along a row
        main-axis, cross-axis (vertical)
    flex-direction: column
        main-axis, cross-axis (horizontal)
    flex-basis (cross-axis): 100px (height for column, width for row, set on the child)

Flexible Layout: Align, Justify, Wrap: https://appbrewery.github.io/flex-layout/

Flex Sizing:
    Priority list
        min-width/max-width > flex-basis > width > content width
        Content width < width < flex-basis < min-width/max-width

    flex-grow: 0/1;
    flex-shrink: 0/1; (0: off; 1: on)
    flex: 1 1 0; (grow shrink basis) = flex: 1
