The Cascade - Specificity and Inheritance
    Position: whether a rule is at the higher or lower position in the CSS relative to other rules
        The lower one replaces the previous one.
        The lower down the file, the more important the rule is.
        li {
            color: red;
            color: blue;
        }
        => On screen: blue

        li {
            color: red;
            color: blue;
        }
        li { color: green; }
        => On screen: green

    Specificity: how specific
        <li id="first-id" class="first-class" draggable>
        li {color: blue;}               | element
        .first-class {color: red;}      | class
        li[draggable] {color: purple;}  | attribute (most cases)
        #first-id {color: orange;}      | id

        id > attribute > class > element

        Multiple class:
        <h1 class="a-class another-class">Hello</h1>
        the lower rule applied.

    Type
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">  | external
        <style> </style>                            | internal
        <h1 style=" ">Hello</h1>                    | inline

        inline > internal > external

    Importance
        color: red;
        color: green !important;
        => green is the MOST important rule;

    Importance > Type > Specificity > Position

Combining CSS Selectors
    element in the class -> descendant within the class
    .[class] [element] {
        property: value;
    }

    Group (using a coma) = apply to both selectors
        selector, selector {
            property: value;
        }
    
    Child (using ">") = apply to direct child of left side (only one generation deep)
        [parent selector] > [child selector] {
            property: value;
        }
    
    Descendant (using a single space) = apply to a descendent of left side
        [ancestor selector] [descendent selector] {
            property: value;
        }
        - recommended unless you want to select the direct child only
    
    Chaining (no separator) = apply where ALL selectors are true
        [selector][selector] {
            property: value;
        }
        Eg: h1#title.big.heading {color: seagreen}
        <h1 id="title" class="big heading">Hello World</h1>
        - be careful cuz it can be confusing
        - start off with an element > class > id
        - no space
    
    Combining Combiners
        [ancestor selector] [selector][selector] {
            property: value;
        }

CSS Positioning
    Static
        HTML default flow
        applied by default
        position:
        top
        left
        right
        bottom

    Relative (mostly used)
        Position relative to default position
        - moved it relative to the default place
        position: relative

    Absolute
        Position relative to nearest positioned ancestor
        or (if no ancestor is positioned then) top left corner of webpage.
        position: absolute

        Z-index (which one on top of which)
            higher z will be on top of the lower one
            set the layer
    Fixed
        Position relative to top left corner of browser window
        when get scrolled, it stays
