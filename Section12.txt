Understanding Colour Theory
    - moods of the colors
        red: love, energy, intensity
        yellow: joy, intellect, attention
        green: freshness, safety, growth
        blue: stability, trust, serenity

        Analogous Colours: two colors next to each other on color wheel
            harmonious: navigation bar, logo and background
            not for standing out
        Complementary colours: for standing out
            for logos, icons
            not for style text and text background
